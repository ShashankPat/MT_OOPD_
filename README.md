#Assignment 1 â€“ Basic Programming Practices
This project consists of two C++ programs that calculate the value of an investment over time. The first program, `main.cpp`, calculates the value of an investment in India, and the second program, `spainmain.cpp`, calculates the value of an investment in Spain.

#Requirements
- C++ compiler (such as g++)
- Make utility

#Commands need to build the file
For main.cpp (india_data.csv):
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing the main.cpp file.
Run the following commands:g++ -c main.cpp -o main.o
                           g++ -o main main.o

For spainmain.cpp (spain_data.csv):
Open a terminal.
Navigate to the directory containing the spainmain.cpp file.
Run the following commands:g++ -c spainmain.cpp -o spainmain.o
                           g++ -o spainmain spainmain.o
